## Scripts to automate MacOS build and updates

`mac-build.sh` A personalised script to bootstrap a fresh MacOS 'out of the box' install, configuring numerous desktop defaults, installing various cli and gui apps with homebrew. 

`mac-update.sh` A personalised script to regularly update my working Mac.

#### Possible improvements and changes
- Both scripts are still work in progress and tested with a MacOS VirtualBox VM
- Still no dotfile management - TBA
- Use a Brewfile instead?
- Will probably move all this to Ansible eventually
