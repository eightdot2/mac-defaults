# Scripts to automate various MacOS configs and changes 

`mac-build.sh` A personalised script to setup a fresh MacOS 'out of the box' install, configuring numerous desktop defaults, installing various cli and gui apps by the app store and homebrew. 

`mac-update.sh` A personalised script to regularly update my working Mac.

# Improvements and changes
- Both scripts are still work in progress and tested with a MacOS VirtualBox VM
- Still no dotfile management - TBA
- Will probably move all this to Ansible eventually
