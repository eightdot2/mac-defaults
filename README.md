## Scripts to automate MacOS build and updates

`mac-build.sh` A personalised script to bootstrap a fresh MacOS 'out of the box' install. Configuring numerous desktop settings and installing various cli and gui apps with homebrew. 

`mac-update.sh` A personalised script to regularly update my working Mac.

#### Possible future improvements
- Both scripts are still work in progress and being tested with a MacOS VirtualBox VM
- Use a Brewfile instead?
